                                            <strong>We had a deal, but now I am alone.</strong>
                                            <p>
                                                In my freshman year, my friend and I made a deal, we would join the World Volunteer Society Club together next year.
                                                We wanted to be an volunteer, to let children everywhere get the same treatment like us when we were a kid.
                                                However, my friend had to drop out of college, and that left me alone.<br/>
                                                I was not sure whether I should follow that deal or not, but in the end I did, and that was the best thing
                                                that every happened to me in college.<br/>
                                            </p>
                                            <strong>Rui-Mei, a place unknown to me.</strong>
                                            <p>
                                                I joined WVS despite the drop out of my friend, I consider this is my way of supporting him back to school.
                                                At WVS I chose to be an volunteer at Rui-Mei elementary school, Hualien, 200 kilometers far from where I live.
                                                Why Rui-Mei you may ask, well no particular reaseon, when I had to make my descision not many information was 
                                                given. I only knew children going to Rui-Mei elementary school most of them are not rich, but not poor either.
                                                What bothers them is their lack of trust, most of their parents are divorced, in jail or even unknown to them. Almost 
                                                everyone was raised by their grandparents, which may not have the energy to take good care of them, a loss of family 
                                                relationship can really affect one's childhood, and the ability to trust others.<br/>
                                            </p>
                                            <strong>We learned the hard way of how to be humble.</strong>
                                            <p>
                                                At first it was tough bonding with the kids at Rui-Mei. Obviously do not trust strangers, but something tells us
                                                not only do they not trust us, they do not trust anybody. By some help given by their teachers, we finally got to know 
                                                their names, though at that time we had no idea how to get close to them, not to mention trying to get to know what bothers 
                                                them.<br/>
                                                We hope to blend in the community, but the age differences was still a little troubling. We tried to step down from our 
                                                arrogance and pride, and listen to what the kids are saying, we tried to join the conversation whenever we get
                                                a chance. Then we started to imitate their action by playing with them, we joined their games and started to run around
                                                the campus like them. We forgot our worries in the city, before we knew, we became part of them.<br/>
                                            </p>
                                            <strong>Opening your heart to others is the best way of expecting them to do the same.</strong>
                                            <p>
                                                Steadily, we built up connection with the kids, and was finally ready to show them what we have prepared. We prepared 
                                                multiple courses regarding family, friendship, love, managing your wealth, etc. As the course started, we found out 
                                                the kids are not paying attention, therfore the messages that we prepared did not pass on to them. We kept searching for 
                                                the best method to attract their attention, it was that moment did we discovered, we were back to the arrogant adult 
                                                again.<br/>
                                                We forfeited our courses,  trying to gain their trust again. It was lucky for us the kids did not mind at all, they
                                                were even thrilled to have us back as their friends, not some stranger that came here to teach boring courses. We chat 
                                                with them, and occasionally they would talk about their family. We listened, not trying to interfere, they are the 
                                                host and we are here to listen to their story. By chatting, my team and I sent our messages to them by chatting, we 
                                                slipped in those boring but important thoughts in our conversation, and they took it with respect, because at that time,
                                                they already consider us as their older brothers and sisters.
                                                <br/>
                                            </p>
                                            <strong>So grateful to be a part of them.</strong>
                                            <p>
                                                Our journey with the kids soon came to an end. As we were heading towards the train station, not just several,
                                                all of them followed. We chat as if t=nothing is going to happen, but both my team and th kids knew a farewell
                                                is unevitable. Time to aboard, tears could not be hold, of course not.<br/>
                                                For them, finally ther is a group of older brothers and sisters that will listen to them, play with them, and 
                                                willing to be a part of them; For us, we finally got to know them, had the chance of making a difference, even 
                                                just a little bit. The time has come, the only thing we could do is wish them to grow up safely, happily.<br/>
                                            </p>
                                            <strong>Rui-Mei, a place unknown to many, but a home to me.</strong>
                                            <p>
                                                I joined WVS despite the drop out of my friend, I stepped into the campus of Rui-Mei by accident, but it was 
                                                beautiful. As an only child, I found my younger brothers and sisters there. The time maybe short, but friendships
                                                last, until now I still receive calls from the kids.<br/>
                                                People say volunteering is giving, I agree with that. But what is more, you will never know what you will receive 
                                                in return. Sometimes it is a card, a peice of cnady, and in my case, a family.<br/>
                                                I told my friend about this amazing experience, it finally cheered him up, he said he wanted to be the giver too. 
                                                I told him: "I thought I was there to give, but I recieved way mor. Being an volunteer is simply
                                                treating people with your heart. Before you know it, pure joy comes knocking on your front door."
